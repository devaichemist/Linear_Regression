# Linear Regression

Here I will implement linear regression with one variable to predict profits for a restaurant franchise.

Suppose you are the CEO of a restaurant franchise and are considering different cities for opening a new outlet.

You would like to expand your business to cities that may give your restaurant higher profits.
 - The chain already has restaurants in various cities and you have data for profits and populations from the cities.
 - You also have data on cities that are candidates for a new restaurant.
   - For these cities, you have the city population.

You can use the data to help you identify which cities may potentially give your business higher profits.

As a result you will get a scatter plot of actual profits vs. city populations with a linear regression line showing the predicted values :
